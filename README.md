Energy Languages Benchmark Setup
===============================

This repository setup code for the [Energy Languages](https://github.com/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages)
with the goal of providing as similar an environment as possible to the 2017
paper published by the Green Software Lab.[^1]

### Rationale

The Energy Languages benchmark is becoming more commonly cited, for example, in
[this article about crypto efficiency](https://cryptomode.com/c-is-the-most-energy-efficient-and-fastest-programming-language-study-finds/)
or [this AWS announcement about switching to Rust](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/sustainability-with-rust/).
